NE day, the cook went into the kitchen to
make some gingerbread. She took some
flour and water, and treacle and ginger, and
mixed them all well together, and she put
in some more water to make it thin, and
then some more flour to make it thick, and
a little salt and some spice, and then she
rolled it out into a beautiful, smooth, dark-yellow
dough.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then she took the square tins and cut out
some square cakes for the little boys, and
with some round tins she cut out some round<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
cakes for the little girls, and then she said,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to make a little gingerbread
man for little Bobby.&rdquo; So she took a nice
round lump of dough for his body, and a
smaller lump for his head, which she pulled
out a little for the neck. Two other lumps
were stuck on beneath for the legs, and were
pulled out into proper shape, with feet and
toes all complete, and two still smaller pieces
were made into arms, with dear little hands
and fingers.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/i010.jpg" width="150" height="186" alt="Gingerbread man" title="Gingerbread man" />
</div>

<p>But the nicest work was done on the
head, for the top was frizzed up into a
pretty sugary hat; on either side was made
a dear little ear, and in front, after
the nose had been carefully moulded,
a beautiful mouth was made out of a
big raisin, and two bright little eyes
with burnt almonds and caraway
seeds.</p>

<p>Then the gingerbread man was finished<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
ready for baking, and a very jolly little man
he was. In fact, he looked so sly that the cook
was afraid he was plotting some mischief,
and when the batter was ready for the oven,
she put in the square cakes and she put in
the round cakes; and then she put in the
little gingerbread man in a far back corner,
where he couldn&rsquo;t get away in a hurry.</p>

<img src="images/i010.jpg" width="150" height="186" alt="Gingerbread man" title="Gingerbread man" />
</div>

<p>Then she went up to sweep the parlor,
and she swept and she swept till the clock
struck twelve, when she dropped her broom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
in a hurry, and exclaiming, &ldquo;Lawks! the
gingerbread will be all baked to a cinder,&rdquo;
she ran down into the kitchen, and threw
open the oven door. And the square cakes
were all done, nice and hard and brown,
and the round cakes were all done, nice and
hard and brown, and the gingerbread man
was all done too, nice and hard and brown;
and he was standing up in his corner, with
his little caraway-seed eyes sparkling, and his
raisin mouth bubbling over with mischief,
while he waited for the oven door to be
opened. The instant the door was opened,
with a hop, skip, and a jump, he
went right over the square cakes
and the round cakes, and over the
cook&rsquo;s arm, and before she could say
&ldquo;Jack Robinson&rdquo; he was running
across the kitchen floor, as fast as his
little legs would carry him, towards the
back door, which was standing wide open, and
through which he could see the garden path.</p>

</div>

<p>The old cook turned round as fast as she
could, which wasn&rsquo;t very fast, for she was
rather a heavy woman and she had been
quite taken by surprise, and she saw lying
right across the door-way, fast asleep in the
sun, old Mouser, the cat.</p>

<p><br /><br />
&ldquo;Mouser, Mouser,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;stop the
gingerbread man! I want him for little
Bobby.&rdquo; When the cook first called,
Mouser thought it was only some one calling
in her dreams, and simply rolled over lazily;
and the cook called again, &ldquo;Mouser,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
Mouser!&rdquo; The old cat sprang up with a
jump, but just as she turned
round to ask the cook what
all the noise was about, the
little gingerbread man cleverly
jumped under her tail, and
in an instant was trotting
down the garden walk.
Mouser turned in a hurry
and ran after, although she
was still rather too sleepy to
know what it was she was
trying to catch, and after
the cat came the cook, lumbering
along rather heavily,
but also making pretty good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
speed.</p>

Now at the bottom of the walk,
lying fast asleep in the sun against
the warm stones of the garden
wall, was Towser, the dog.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em;">And the cook called out:
&ldquo;Towser, Towser, stop the gingerbread
man! I want him for
little Bobby.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em;">And when Towser first heard
her calling he thought it
was some one speaking
in his dreams, and he
only turned over
on his side, with
another snore, and then the cook called<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
again, &ldquo;Towser, Towser, stop him, stop
him!&rdquo;</p>

<img src="images/i015.jpg" width="250" height="136" alt="Sleeping cat" title="Sleeping cat" />
</div>

<p>Then the dog woke up in good earnest,
and jumped up on his feet to see what
it was that he should stop. But just as
the dog jumped up, the little gingerbread
man, who had been watching for the
chance, quietly slipped between his legs, and
climbed up on the top of the stone wall,
so that Towser saw nothing but the cat
running towards him down the walk, and
behind the cat the cook, now quite out of
breath.</p>

takes a tumble" title="Cook takes a tumble" />
</div>

<p>He thought at once that the cat must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
have stolen something, and that it was
the cat the cook wanted him to stop.
Now, if there was anything that Towser
liked, it was going after the cat, and he
jumped up the walk so fiercely
that the poor cat did
not have time to stop herself or to get out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
of his way, and they came together with a
great fizzing, and barking, and meowing,
and howling, and scratching, and biting, as
if a couple of Catherine-wheels had gone
off in the wrong way and had got mixed up
with one another.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/i017.jpg" width="150" height="203" alt="Cat and dog" title="Cat and dog" />
</div>

<p>But the old cook had been running so
hard that she was not able to stop herself
any better than the cat had done, and she
fell right on top of the mixed up dog and
cat, so that all three rolled over on the
walk in a heap together.</p>

<p>And the cat scratched whichever came
nearest, whether it was a piece of the dog
or of the cook, and the dog bit at whatever
came nearest, whether it was a piece
of the cat or of the cook, so that the poor
cook was badly pummelled on both
sides.</p>

<p>After a little while,
the cat managed to pull
herself out from under the cook
and the dog, and a very cast-down and
crumpled-up-looking cat she was. She had
had enough of hunting gingerbread men, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
she crept back to the kitchen to repair
damages.</p>
</div>

<p>The dog, who was very cross because his
face had been badly scratched, let go of the
cook, and at last, catching sight of the gingerbread
man, made a bolt for the garden
wall. The cook picked herself up, and
although her face was also badly scratched
and her dress was
torn, she was
determined
to see the end
of the chase,
and she followed after
the dog, though this time more slowly.</p>

&nbsp;on the farther

began running across

Now in<br /> the middle of the field was a
tree, and at the <br />foot of the tree was lying
Jocko, the monkey. He <br />wasn&rsquo;t asleep&mdash;monkeys
never are&mdash;and when he<br /> saw the
little man running across the field and heard<br />
the cook calling, &ldquo;Jocko, Jocko,
stop the gingerbread<br /> man,&rdquo; he
at once gave one big jump.
But he jumped so<br />
fast and so far that
he went right
over the gingerbread<br /> man, and as luck<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
would have it, he came down on the<br /> back
of Towser, the dog, who had just scrambled
over<br /> the wall, and whom he had not before
noticed. Towser was naturally taken by
surprise, but he turned his head around
and promptly bit off the end of the
monkey&rsquo;s tail, and Jocko quickly jumped
off again, chattering his
indignation.</p>

instant he also was at the top of the tree.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/i010.jpg" width="150" height="186" alt="Gingerbread man" title="Gingerbread man" />
</div>

<p>The gingerbread man crawled out to the
furthermost end of the branch, and hung by
one hand, but the monkey swung himself
under the branch, and stretching out his long
arm, he pulled the gingerbread man in.
Then he held him up and looked at him so
hungrily that the little raisin mouth began
to pucker down at the corners, and the
caraway-seed eyes filled with tears.</p>

<p>And then what do you think happened?
Why, little Bobby himself came running
up. He had been taking his noon-day
nap upstairs, and in his dreams it seemed
as if he kept hearing people call
&ldquo;Little Bobby, little Bobby!&rdquo; until
finally he jumped up with a start, and
was so sure that some one was calling
him that he ran down-stairs, without
even waiting to put on his shoes.</p>

he heard someone calling." title="Bobby thought he heard someone calling" />
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>As he came down, he could see through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
the window in the field beyond the garden
the cook, and the dog, and the monkey,
and could even hear the barking of Towser
and the chattering of Jocko. He scampered
down the walk, with his little bare
feet pattering against the warm gravel,
climbed over the wall, and in a few seconds
arrived under the tree, just as Jocko was
holding up the poor little gingerbread man.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;">
<img src="images/i022.jpg" width="650" height="342" alt="In field" title="In field" />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Drop it, Jocko!&rdquo; cried Bobby, and drop
it Jocko did, for he always had to mind Bobby.
He dropped it so straight that the gingerbread
man fell right into Bobby&rsquo;s uplifted pinafore.</p>

<p>Then Bobby held him up and looked at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
him, and the little raisin mouth puckered
down lower than ever, and the tears ran right
out of the caraway-seed eyes.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/i023tn3.jpg" width="150" height="172" alt="&quot;1/3 gone&quot;" title="&quot;1/3 gone&quot;" />
</div>

<p>But Bobby was too hungry to mind gingerbread
tears, and he gave one big bite,
and swallowed down both legs and
a piece of the body.</p>

<p>&ldquo;OH!&rdquo; said the gingerbread man,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;M ONE-THIRD GONE!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/i024tn3.jpg" width="150" height="200" alt="&quot;2/3 gone&quot;" title="&quot;2/3 gone&quot;" />
</div>

<p>Bobby gave a second bite, and
swallowed the rest of the body and
the arms.</p>



<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Oh!</span>&rdquo; said the gingerbread
man, &ldquo;<span class="smcap">I&rsquo;m two-thirds gone!</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bobby gave a third bite, and
gulped down the head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Oh!</i>&rdquo; said the gingerbread
man, &ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;m all gone!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so he was&mdash;and that is
the end of the story.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
